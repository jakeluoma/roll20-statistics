Chaos Bolt (+6)
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type. 1 Acid. 2 Cold. 3 Fire. 4 Force. 5 Lightning. 6 Poison. 7 Psychic. 8 Thunder.
If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

Breath Weapon
Racial: Dragonborn
You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your blue draconic ancestry means this exhalation is a 5 by 30 ft. line dealing lightning damage.
When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

Background: Fisher/Hunter
As a Bonus Action, secure a length of rope to the end of a barbed crossbow bolt so that it grapples the target on hit in addition to dealing damage.

As an Action, yank on the rope connected to a grappled target to deal 1d4 Piercing and make the grappled creature make a DC11 STR Save or be pulled 10ft toward you.

A grappled creature may use an action to attack the rope (DC=8, HP=5 Slashing) or pull the barbed bolt out (DC12 CON Save or take 2d4 Piercing, half-damage on save).
