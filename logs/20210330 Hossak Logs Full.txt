Divine Sense
Class: Paladin
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestia⁠l, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampi⁠re Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

Flabnatz (GM):What do you want to do next? Anna is going to offer you three quests to continue working in her service, if you want. Feel free to discuss while each of you has their one-on-one time with me.
Search the coasts of Hossak for any sign of invaders and quell whatever havoc you find.
Root out a traitor?. ...in Port Mettis? ...or find any information on them?
Investigate the ports Anna’s father last visited to find the same information he did. Pick up the trail and his conclusions. See what else you can find out.
You are not compelled to take up any one of these. They are just things that Anna wants done and is willing to employ your services to handle. If you have any other designs or desires, that works just as well!
