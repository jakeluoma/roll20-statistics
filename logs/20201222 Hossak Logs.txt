Chaos Bolt (+6)
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type. 1 Acid. 2 Cold. 3 Fire. 4 Force. 5 Lightning. 6 Poison. 7 Psychic. 8 Thunder.
If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

Background: Fisher/Hunter
As a Bonus Action, secure a length of rope to the end of a barbed crossbow bolt so that it grapples the target on hit in addition to dealing damage.

As an Action, yank on the rope connected to a grappled target to deal 1d4 Piercing and make the grappled creature make a DC11 STR Save or be pulled 10ft toward you.

A grappled creature may use an action to attack the rope (DC=8, HP=5 Slashing) or pull the barbed bolt out (DC12 CON Save or take 2d4 Piercing, half-damage on save).
